# About

The goal of this project is to update the existing PolyGen manuals (Italian and English) by first porting them from HTML to pandoc markdown, and then convert them to HTML5 and other formats.

The original manuals were written by [Alvise Spanò] (author of PolyGen), and can be downloaded from:

- http://lapo.it/polygen/polygen-1.0.6-20040705-doc.zip 

Currently, the English manual translation is incomplete; its completion is among the goals of this project.

This project is maintained by [Tristano Ajmone] with the blessings of PolyGen's author Alvise Spanò.

# Development Status

All the preliminary draft work is taking place in branches, and the documents won't be added to `master` until they are ready for distribution. This is in order to keep out of the main branch's history all the drafts and preparatory stages.

Current development can be followed in the [`draftwork`][draftwork] branch, and contributions therein are welcome.

# License

- [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)

The manuals are released under the same license of PolyGen: GNU GLP version 2 (or above).
